## Real estate website application (EmlakBizim) with ASP.NET MVC5.
### EmlakBizim Api Addresses

If we want to start the project with Microsoft Visual Studio, we start the project by right-clicking on the "\Views\Home\Index.cshtml" file while the project is open and selecting "View in Browser ([Selected Browser](https://www.google.com.tr/))".
If we want, we can also use "\Index.cshtml" of other "\Views" files to see how other pages look.
However, it's best to start the project with "\Views\Home\Index.cshtml" to run it properly.
The project runs on "localhost:?/".
- Some packages can be installed from the "[NuGet Gallery](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.Core)" with the help of the "Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console".
