# Real estate website application (EmlakBizim) with ASP.NET MVC5.

## EmlakBizim Api Addresses

If we want to start the project with [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), we start the project by right-clicking on the "[\Views\Home\Index.cshtml](https://github.com/AtakanTurgut/emlakbizim/blob/master/emlakBizim/Views/Home/Index.cshtml)" file while the project is open and selecting "View in Browser ([Selected Browser](https://www.google.com.tr/))".

If we want, we can also use "\Index.cshtml" of other "[\Views](https://github.com/AtakanTurgut/emlakbizim/tree/master/emlakBizim/Views)" files to see how other pages look.

However, it's best to start the project with "[\Views\Home\Index.cshtml](https://github.com/AtakanTurgut/emlakbizim/blob/master/emlakBizim/Views/Home/Index.cshtml)" to run it properly.

The application also has an admin panel. Admin can perform operations such as adding, deleting, updating, seeing all places.

The project runs on "[localhost:?/](https://localhost:44330/)".

- Some packages can be installed from the "[NuGet Gallery](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.Core)" with the help of the "Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console".
